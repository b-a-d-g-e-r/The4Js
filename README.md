Group Homework Project - for Computer Science TERM 3

This will comprise of four games, two of which have been chosen for us - wordle/ lingo and minesweeper. The other two should be chosen collectively by us.
We must code these individually and compile a program consisting of all four including a menu system so the user can select the desired game.
This will be done by the end of the term.
